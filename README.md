- setup microROS for ROS communication between STM32 and ROS2 Humble
- Differential drive to control the rover

### Tasks Under Progress
- Interfacing wheel encoders using interrupts

### Tasks Left
- Interfacing IMU
- getting odometry working
- writing the code for PID control of Linear and Angular Velocity
- writing the code for EKF
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using liDAR
- interfacing kinnect sensor or another stereo camera for 3D depth mapping

## Version
### Current Version: 1.0.0
- microROS sending and recieving data
- can control left right forward and backward using cmd_vel and teleoptwist keyboard
