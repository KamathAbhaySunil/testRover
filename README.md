- Differential drive to control the rover

### Tasks Under Progress
- Interfacing wheel ecoders using interrupts

### Tasks Left
- Interfacing IMU
- getting odometry working
- writing the code for PID control of Linear and Angular Velocity
- writing the code for EKF
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using liDAR
- interfacing kinnect sensor or another stereo camera for 3D depth mapping

## Version
### Current Version: 1.0.0
